General Graphics:

        Vertex Shader -> Clipping -> Rasterization -> Fragment Shader
    
    Clipping
        Points: Not really clipped. If a point is in any way outside of the clipping volume, entire primitive is discarded.

        Lines: If entire line is outside of the clipping area, entire line is discarded, otherwise line is clipped.

        Triangles: A triangle is clipped to the viewing volumeby generating appropriate triangles whose vertices are on the boundary of the fclipping volume.
